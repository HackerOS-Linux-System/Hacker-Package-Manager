# Hacker Package Manager
The hpm tool allows you to install and remove apt packages (nicer look), graphically install apt, flatpak, snap packages, install tools/app packages from the community repository (you can create and report them).

## Fronted for APT
The hpm tool has a nicer look for apt + the same functionality, this part is written in rust.

## Community Repository
HPM has a community repository; you can create your own repo and submit it (here's a repo template: https://github.com/Bytes-Repository/hpm-example-repo). You can submit reports to hackeros's gmail: hackeros068@gmail.com.

## Graphical package installation
HPM has the ability to graphically install packages (specifically, in Tui, not through a GUI). You can install packages from apt, flatpak, or snap there.
